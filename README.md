## Overview ‚ú® 
**Inventory Master** is an inventory management web-app that helps users to manage their inventories. Users can add other signed-up users as 'Managers' to update item quantities as they are used and to suggest adding new items or removing existing ones from the inventory. Additionally, there is a unified shopping list feature that helps users maintain their stock levels.

## Motivation üß† 
As a member of a joint-family household, I have always found it overwhelming to track the items and their quantities at home. The need for better household management and tracking item quantities in different rooms led to the idea of creating this app.
