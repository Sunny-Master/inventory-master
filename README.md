## Overview
**Inventory Master** is an inventory management web-app that users can use manage their inventory items. They also have an option to add other users as "Managers" for updating the quantity of the items, as and when that item is used.  

## Motivation
As a member of a joint-family household, I have always found it overwhelming to track the items and their quantities in our home. The motivation to better manage the household and to keep track of the quantities of all the items in different rooms resulted in conceptualization of this app.
